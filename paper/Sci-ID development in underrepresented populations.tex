\section{Introduction}

    This review was developed in order to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within the undergraduate biology and/or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) settings. Specifically, this review aims to provide literature and recommendations to advance marginalized students' scientific identity (Sci-ID). Moreover, this review proposes an extension of the definition of Sci-ID drawing from the principles of computational identity (CI).

    \subsection{Scientific identity}

        Scientific identity (Sci-ID) is broadly defined as an identity model of one's inner sense of their alignment with science: whether or not they are a ``science person''.\footcite{salehjee_models_2018} \cite{oseguera_examining_2019} found that Black students had significantly lower Sci-ID than their white counterparts and identified that Sci-ID is a strong predictor of persistnce in science. Moreover, the study found that intervention targeted towards improving Black students' Sci-ID is successful in raising Sci-ID to levels comparable to their white counterparts.\footcite{oseguera_examining_2019}
        
        Sci-ID development, therefore, is important to understand. \cite{salehjee_models_2018} establishes a seven-domain conjugated model of Sci-ID development. Sci-ID is influenced by: (1) global forces, such as one's identity, (2) social agencies and agents, such as educational institutes, teachers, and parents, (3) transformational learning experiences, including accidental and planned events that shapes one's perception of science, (4) one's openness to new information, (5) personal preference that selects for favored learning experiences, (6) individual internal agency, or one's internal drive to develop their Sci-ID, and (7) their core identity, which can be stable or fluid. Domains 1-3 direct information through domains 4-6, which filter what information acts on and develops domain 7, the core Sci-ID.\footcite{salehjee_models_2018}

        Sci-ID's development is well-defined, however, Sci-ID itself varies in definition across literature. Thus, this review proposes a three-part definition drawing upon an analog from computer science: computational identity (CI). \cite{brousseau_position_2019} defines CI as a key factor in students' persistence in the pursuit of computing comprising of three components: (1) the perception that computing is useful, (2) self-efficacy in computing, and (3) a sense of belonging in computing.\footcite{brousseau_position_2019} Using this definition, this paper proposes a generalization of CI to Sci-ID, defining Sci-ID by three analogous components: (1) the perception that science is useful, (2) self-efficacy in science, and (3) a sense of belonging in science.\footcite{brousseau_position_2019} This definition is summarized in figure \ref{fig:sci_id}.

            \label{fig:sci_id}
            \rule{\columnwidth}{1pt}
        \end{figure}

        \subsubsection{Perception that science is useful}

            An integral aspect of one's Sci-ID is one's perception that science is useful, in other words, they must have a sense that science is ``worth doing''. Moreover, one must feel that science is functional and applicable to their life. This is important as, per Eccles' expectancy-value theory\footcite{wigfield_expectancyvalue_2000}, the higher a student's subjective task value for science (their perception of the value and utility of learning and doing science), the more motivated they are to persist in science.\footcite{brousseau_position_2019} This perception that science is useful is critical to one's Sci-ID as it directly impacts their motivation and persistence in science.

        \subsubsection{Science self efficacy}

            Science self-efficacy is one's own confidence in their ability to do science.\footcite{ballen_enhancing_2017} To elaborate, it is one's sense that not only can they do science, but in combination with their perception that science is useful, the things they can do with science have utility and impact.\footcite{brousseau_position_2019}  \cite{bandura_perceived_1993} found that one's self efficacy is a strong indicator of one's anxiety, motivation, and performance in a given domain; high self-efficacy conflates with strong performance and motivation with minimized anxiety whereas low self-efficacy is accompanied by high anxiety, a lack of motivation, and poor performance.\footcite{bandura_perceived_1993} Thus, it becomes apparent that science self efficacy is critical to one's Sci-ID; their confidence in science directly impacts their motivation to persist and their performance.

        \subsubsection{Sense of belonging in science}

            \begin{figure*}[t!]

Privileged students are represented in red and marginalized students are represented in blue.}
                \label{fig:sense_of_belonging}
                \rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
            \end{figure*}

            A student's sense of belonging consists of two major components: comfortability and fitting in; these components manifest across three domains: environment, relationships, and involvement. Students feel as though they belong when they feel comfort with others and in their surroundings and that they fit in with others and their surroundings on their campus.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016}
            
            Developing a sense of belonging differs between marginalized and privileged students. It is important to understand how to support a sense of belonging for both types of students.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016} Figure \ref{fig:sense_of_belonging} summarizes the key elements of the development of the sense of belonging and how it differs between privileged and marginalized students across the three domains. \cite{vaccaro_development_2016} found key differences emerge when analyzing the sense of belonging for marginalized students. In addition to feeling comfortable and fitting in, marginalized students value safety and respect where they feel physically safe in their settings, welcomed, accepted, and that both themself and their culture are respected.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016}

            Students' environment impacts their sense of belonging; this impact varies greatly between marginalized and privileged students. Privileged students feel a sense of belonging in environments in which they describe as friendly, fun, and comfortable; these students typically attribute a sense of belonging exclusively to positive descriptors regarding their environment. Marginalized students, however, typically feel a lack of belonging in their environment as a result of feeling like the ``only one'' due to a lack of campus diversity and a restriction of authenticity in their expression due to judgement from peers and unfair treatment. Thus, marginalized students require support in their authentic expression and diverse representation to feel belonging in their environment.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016}

            Relationships are critical to students' sense of belonging. Privileged students seek a sense of familiarity with others, having fun, and receiving support in tasks in order to feel a sense of belonging. Marginalized students, rather, require deep connection and the ability to be comfortably authentic in their relationships in order to have a sense of belonging. Moreover, marginalized students may actively reject relationships that do not embrace their authentic expression.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016}

            Involvement, too, is crucial to students' sense of belonging. Again, privileged and marginalized students value different aspects of belonging in involvement. Privileged students value fun and enjoyable involvement and when their involvement has a perceivable impact. Marginalized students, on the other hand, require involvement that allows and encourages authentic expression. Further, marginalized students value involvement that fosters authentic conversations and connections. This sense of authenticity is critical for marginalized students; involvement that did not nurture this authenticity did not foster belonging for these students and often led to these students discontinuing their involvement.\footcite{vaccaro_development_2016}

            % A student's sense of belonging, too, is critical to their Sci-ID, and therefore their performance and persistance in science. It becomes apparent that this sense of belonging must be prioritized and nurtured along with the other aspects of marginalized students' Sci-ID

            Therefore, a marginalized students' sense of belonging is critical to their development and maintenance of Sci-ID, and thus, their performance and persistence in science. Their sense of belonging must be prioritized and nurtured, along with the other aspects of their Sci-ID.

    \subsection{Nurturing scientific identities of marginalized students}
        
        Given the dependence of marginalized students' perserverance and performance in science on scientific identity (Sci-ID), it becomes increasingly apparent that educational institutions must nurture marginalized students' Sci-IDs. For the undergraduate sciences, this paper presents a glossary of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-oriented terms sourced from recent academic journal articles, domain-specific recommendations, and an index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists to be used by undergraduate professors to nurture the Sci-ID of marginalized students and proposed studies to evaluate the efficacy of these recommendations and resources. 

\section{Methodology}
        
    The recommended intervention provided in this paper --- the glossary, recommendations, and index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists --- is suggested for use to develop the scientific identity based upon reviewed literature. It, however, has not been validated. Thus, this paper provides a proposed study design accompanied by survey instruments to collect student identities, measure scientific identity of students, quantify instructor adherence to guidelines, and calculate a coefficient of relevance representative of the degree to which these guidelines apply to a given course.

    This study design seeks to do the following three items: (1) validate the instruments, (2) describe the current landscape of Sci-ID across students of different identities at Emmanuel College, and (3) evaluate the utility of the recommended intervention in the improvement of student Sci-ID. 

    \subsection{The Measurements and Instruments}

        The instruments to be employed in the proposed study are defined herein. It should be noted that these are named measurements and the instruments that measure them are referred to explicitly as instruments.

        \subsubsection{Quantification of Sci-ID (QoS)}
            The instrument to measure student Sci-ID, or their Quantification of Sci-ID (QoS) is defined in instrument \ref{inst:sci-id}. It calculates a QoS score from 0 - 50, 0 being no Sci-ID, 50 being the most Sci-ID. It measures both the student's perception of their Sci-ID over the three domains and their effective Sci-ID.

        \subsubsection{Qualitative Identity Index (QII)}
            The instrument used to describe a student's identity, their Qualitative Identity Index (QII), is defined in instrument \ref{inst:identity-inv}. Their QII describes the student's comprehensive identities and their effective privileges and power.

        \subsubsection{Instructor Guideline Adherence Rating (IGAR)}
            The instrument used to rate a course's instructor based upon their adherence to the intervention guidelines recommended by this paper, or their Instructor Guideline Adherence Rating (IGAR), is defined in instrument \ref{inst:instructor-adherence}. The IGAR scores instructors from 0 - 10, 0 being no adherence, 10 being consistent and strong adherence based upon both their presentation of information and the resources they provide to students, including textbooks, slides, handouts, and more.
        
        \subsubsection{Course Coefficient of Relevance (CCoR)}
            The instrument used to measure a course's relevance and the applicability of the guidelines recommended in this paper, or the Course Coefficient of Relevance (CCoR), is defined in instrument \ref{inst:relevance-coeff}. It calculates a coefficient from 0 - 1 that describes to what degree and/or what portion of the guidelines apply, 0 being not at all, 1 being completely.
    
    \subsection{Research Questions}

        This study aims to pose research questions accompanied by hypotheses and study designs to achieve the defined goals.      

        \subsubsection{Research Question 1: Are the instruments valid?}

            In order to evaluate student Sci-ID both pre- and post-intervention, the instrument measuring Sci-ID, the QoS instrument, and its supporting instruments measuring environmental variables must all be validated. It is hypothesized that, if the QoS instrument is valid, then the QoS and the students' final grades would have a statistically significant positive correlation. The remaining three instruments measure environmental variables that are suspected to impact Sci-ID. These are the QII, IGAR, and CCoR instruments. It is hypothesized that the IGAR instrument is valid if the IGAR significantly and positively correlates to the students' change in QoS. Continuing, the CCoR instrument is hypothesized to be valid if the variance of student QoS significantly and inversely relates to the CCoR. Finally, the QII instrument is hypothesized to be valid if student QoS varies insignificantly within populations with similar responses.

        \subsubsection{Research Question 2: What is the current landscape of undergraduate STEM student Sci-ID?}

            This portion of the study aims to describe the current Sci-ID of undergraduate students in STEM and how it differs between students of different identities in order to identify populations of students with higher risks of poor performance and low perserverance in STEM using a descriptive study design. Thus, this study will compare QII variables to initial QoS scores to identify any vulnerable populations.

        \subsubsection{Research Question 3: How does the proposed intervention change undergraduate STEM student Sci-ID?}
            
            This portion of the study aims to assess the efficacy of the proposed intervention in improving STEM student Sci-ID both across all students and within underrepresented populations. It shall follow a before-after study design in which student QoS scores are measured before and after the intervention and the change in QoS is analyzed in relation to student QIIs, IGARs, and the CCoRs. It is hypothesized that if the intervention defined in this paper is effective in improving all student's Sci-ID, QoS scores will show a statistically significant positive change. The IGAR and CCoR will be used to assess which components of the intervention are most impactful under the hypothesis that for each component, if that component is effective in developing student Sci-ID, then the component's IGAR and CCoR subscores will have a statistically significant positive correlation to the change in QoS scores. There also will be a descriptive component analyzing the change in QoS scores between students of different identities using the QII.

    \subsection{The Proposed Study Design}

        This study shall follow the design as defined chronologically herein. Within the first 14 days of a 16 week course, the students will be assessed for their QoS and optionally their QII using their respective instruments. After 7 - 9 weeks, the instructor and/or an auditor will evaluate the instructor for their IGAR using the IGAR instrument. Within the last 2 weeks of the course, students will be assessed for their QoS and optionnally their QII using their respective instruments. Instructors will be assessed for their IGAR by the instructors and/or an auditor using the IGAR instrument and the course's CCoR will be calculated by the instructor, study administrators, and/or auditors, using the CCoR isntrument. These measurements will be statistically analyzed as appropriate.

\section{The Glossary}
    
    The glossary was constructed from a review of literature. The glossary lists: \\

    \gitemp{inclusive terms}{ that are suggested for use by individuals that are not part of the community and/or identity being discussed which are denoted with a $\blacktriangleright$ and highlighting them in blue.}

    \gitemn{exclusive terms}{ that are not suggested for use by individuals that are not part of the community and/or identity being discussedthat do not identify with the identity in reference which are denoted with a $\blacktriangleleft$ and highlighting them in gray.}

    \noindent It should be noted that these classifications are based on their use by individuals who are not a part of the community and/or identity being discussed; Ultimately, individuals who identify with the identity and/or community being discussed should be listened to and their self-identified labels and chosen terminology should be used. Self-labelling and chosen terminology is, typically, a result of personal context, intersectionality, self-agency, and, in some cases, a form of resistance.\footcite{wagaman_self-definition_2016} It should be the right of individuals who identify with the identity and/or community to make these choices as it empowers them and centers their needs and autonomy in discussions regarding them. \footcite{botha_does_2021}
    
    Additionally, these classifications make no indication on the moral good or bad of the term they are describing, rather they indicate the general acceptability of using that term to describe the phenomenon.

    Finally, it should be noted that, in this paper, these definitions are categorized under the category of which they are most related to. This method of categorization, however, is not representative of intersectionality of identities. Thus, readers are encouraged to visit the digital glossary at github.com/ec-belonging-in-biology/sci-id-development where each definition is tagged with each of its relevant categories and can be filtered, which better represents the intersectional nature of the terms defined herein.
