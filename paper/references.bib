	abstract = {Aims and objectives To describe nurses confusion around trans* terminology and to provide a lesson in Trans* 101 for readers. Background Of the estimated 9 million persons in the United States of America who are identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, about 950,000 (0·2–0·5\% of adult population) are identified as trans* (a term that encompasses the spectrum, including transgender, transsexual, trans man, trans woman and other terms). The Institute of Medicine (2011, The health of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people: Building a foundation for better understanding. The National Academies Press, Washington, DC) identified transgender persons as an understudied population with significant need for health research, yet the nursing literature contains little guidance for educating nurses on trans* issues. Design This is a mixed methods structured interview design with nurse key informants. The scripted interview was based on the Health Care Equality Index, which evaluates patient-centred care to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients and families. These data were part of a larger research study that explored the current state of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-sensitive nursing practice. Method Undergraduate nursing students recruited and interviewed 268 nurse key informants about gender inclusive forms (capable of identifying trans* patients) at their agencies. Results Only 5\% reported use of gender inclusive forms, 44\% did not know about inclusive forms, 37\% did not understand what a gender inclusive form was and 14\% confused gender with sexual orientation. Conclusion The study demonstrated a critical need for education in gender identity and sexual orientation terminology. Relevance to clinical practice The lack of understanding of concepts and terminology may affect basic care of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients especially those who identify as transgender.},

Additionally, biology can present unique challenges for LGBTQ+ students because of the relationship between certain biology topics and their LGBTQ+ identities. Currently, there is no centralized set of guidelines to make biology learning environments more inclusive for LGBTQ+ individuals. Rooted in prior literature and the collective expertise of the authors who identify as members and allies of the LGBTQ+ community, we present a set of actionable recommendations to help biologists, biology educators, and biology education researchers be more inclusive of individuals with LGBTQ+ identities. These recommendations are intended to increase awareness of LGBTQ+ identities and spark conversations about transforming biology learning spaces and the broader academic biology community to become more inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals.},

Approaches to solve this have shifted from focusing on student deficits to changing campus culture, including the mindsets of instructors who teach STEM courses. In this article, I argue that based on the literature informing the conceptual frameworks used for faculty development in inclusive teaching, faculty developers should reframe the message of their workshops to focus participants more on the scope of the journey, and shift the direction of overall efforts some to redevelop pedagogical training at the graduate and postdoc levels. Informed by historical as well as recent theories on the role of higher education to society, I highlight the areas of the literature that can effectively inform our current approaches to inclusion. I also briefly review the reasons why this approach is needed, and include suggestions for new faculty development approaches for long-term sustainable change in STEM inclusive education at the postsecondary level.},

	abstract = {Developments in biology and genetics in recent decades have caused significant shifts in the understanding and conceptualization of human biological variation. Humans vary biologically in different ways, including individually, due to age, ancestry, and sex. An understanding of the complexities of all levels of biological variation is necessary for efficient health care delivery. Important steps in teaching medical students about human variation could be carried out in anatomy classes, and thus, it is important that anatomical education absorbs new developments in how biological variation is comprehended. Since the early 1990s biological sex in humans has been vigorously investigated by scientists, social scientists, and interest groups. Consequently, the binary division in male and female sex has been called into question and a more fluid understanding of sex has been proposed. Some of the major textbooks teach anatomy, particularly of the urogenital system, as a male-female binary. Anatomical sciences curricula need to adopt a more current approach to sex including the introduction of the category of “intersex”/“differences in sexual development” and present sex as a continuum rather than two sharply divided sets of characteristics. This approach offers a better understanding of the complexity of sex differences and, at the same time, provides students with an improved theoretical framework for understanding human variation in general, transcending the limitations of biological typology. When well delivered, the non-binary approach could play a significant contribution to the formation of competent and responsible medical practitioners and avoidance of problematic practices such as non-consensual “normalizing” surgeries.},

	abstract = {For over a century, genetic arguments for the existence of racial inequality have been used to oppose policies that promote social equality. And, over that same time period, American biology textbooks have repeatedly discussed genetic differences between races. This experiment tests whether racial terminology in the biology curriculum causes adolescents to develop genetic beliefs about racial difference, thereby affecting prejudice. Individual students (N = 135, grades 7–9) were randomly assigned within their classrooms to learn either from: (i) four text-based lessons discussing racial differences in skeletal structure and the prevalence of genetic disease (racial condition); or (ii) an identical curriculum lacking racial terminology (nonracial condition). Over 3-months that coincided with this learning, students in the racial condition grew significantly more in their perception of the amount of genetic variation between races relative to students in the nonracial condition. Furthermore, those in the racial condition grew in their belief that races differ in intelligence for genetic reasons significantly more than those in the nonracial condition. And, compared to the nonracial condition, students in the racial condition became significantly less interested in socializing across racial lines and less supportive of policies that reduce racial inequality in education. These findings show how biology education sustains racial inequality, and conversely, how human genetic variation education could be designed to reduce genetically based racism. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Markers of inclusion that are sometimes overlooked at these events can include the composition of panels, how workshops are run, the affordability of conferences, and various other mechanisms that maintain pre-existing hierarchies and norms that limit the participation of early-career researchers and individuals of minoritized cultural, linguistic, and economic backgrounds. The Inclusive Environments and Metrics in Biology Education and Research (iEMBER) network coordinates efforts of researchers from many fields interested in diversity and inclusion in biology education. Given the concerns regarding inclusion at professional meetings, iEMBER has developed and implemented several practices in planning and executing our meetings to make them more inclusive. In this report, we share our experiences developing inclusive meetings on biology education research and discuss the outcomes of such efforts. Specifically, we present our approach to planning and executing the iEMBER 2019 conference and the National Association of Biology Teachers iEMBER 2019 workshop. This report adds to the growing body of resources on inclusive meetings, provides readers with an account of how such an attempt at implementation might unfold, and complements existing theories and work relating to the importance and functioning of such meetings in terms of representation in STEM.},

Carried out in a public high school in the San Francisco Bay Area, students recruited for the study (N = 86) were randomly assigned to read either a racially framed or a nonracially framed textbook passage on genetic diseases as part of a unit on Mendelian genetics. Afterwards, they responded to two instruments measuring belief in the biological/genetic basis of race and one measure that recorded their explanations of the racial achievement gap and their willingness to volunteer their free time to fix it. Results demonstrated that students in the racially framed condition exhibited significantly greater agreement in the genetic basis of racial difference than students in the nonracially framed condition. A content analysis of students’ explanations of the achievement gap also demonstrated that a significantly greater proportion of students gave genetic explanations of the achievement gap in the racially framed condition compared to the other condition. Furthermore, students’ prior beliefs about race interacted with the reading treatments to affect students’ willingness to fix the racial achievement gap.},

However, there is apparently no research that explores if the reverse is possible. Does teaching adolescents scientifically accurate information about genetic variation within and between US census races reduce their racial biases? We randomized 8th and 9th grade students (n = 166) into separate classrooms to learn for an entire week either about the topics of (a) human genetic variation or (b) climate variation. In a cross-over randomized trial with clustering, we demonstrate that when students learn about genetic variation within and between racial groups it significantly changes their perceptions of human genetic variation, thereby causing a significant decrease in their scores on instruments assessing cognitive forms of prejudice. We then replicate these findings in two computer-based randomized controlled trials, one with adults (n = 176) and another with biology students (n = 721, 9th–12th graders). These results indicate that teaching about human variation in the domain of genetics has potentially powerful effects on social cognition during adolescence. In turn, we argue that learning about the social and quantitative complexities of human genetic variation research could prepare students to become informed participants in a society where human genetics is invoked as a rationale in sociopolitical debates.},

However, despite the critical importance of the learning environment in increasing conceptual understanding, little research has investigated what instructors say and do to create learning environments in college biology classrooms. We systematically investigated the language used by instructors that does not directly relate to course content and defined the construct of Instructor Talk. Transcripts were generated from a semester-long, cotaught introductory biology course (n = 270 students). Transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to identify emergent categories of Instructor Talk. The five emergent categories from analysis of more than 600 quotes were, in order of prevalence, 1) Building the Instructor/Student Relationship, 2) Establishing Classroom Culture, 3) Explaining Pedagogical Choices, 4) Sharing Personal Experiences, and 5) Unmasking Science. Instances of Instructor Talk were present in every class session analyzed and ranged from six to 68 quotes per session. The Instructor Talk framework is a novel research variable that could yield insights into instructor effectiveness, origins of student resistance, and methods for overcoming stereotype threat. Additionally, it holds promise in professional development settings to assist instructors in reflecting on the learning environments they create.},

These dynamics can be influenced by student social identities. One social identity that has been unexamined in the context of undergraduate biology is the spectrum of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) identities. In this exploratory interview study, we probed the experiences and perceptions of seven students who identify as part of the LGBTQIA community. We found that students do not always experience the undergraduate biology classroom to be a welcoming or accepting place for their identities. In contrast to traditional lectures, active-learning classes increase the relevance of their LGBTQIA identities due to the increased interactions among students during group work. Finally, working with other students in active-learning classrooms can present challenges and opportunities for students considering their LGBTQIA identity. These findings indicate that these students’ LGBTQIA identities are affecting their experience in the classroom and that there may be specific instructional practices that can mitigate some of the possible obstacles. We hope that this work can stimulate discussions about how to broadly make our active-learning biology classes more inclusive of this specific population of students.},

	abstract = {abstract: Guided by Tinto’s Theory of College Student Departure, I conducted a set of five studies to identify factors that influence students’ social integration in college science active learning classes.  These studies were conducted in large-enrollment college science courses and some were specifically conducted in undergraduate active learning biology courses.  Using qualitative and quantitative methodologies, I identified how students’ identities, such as their gender and LGBTQIA identity, and students’ perceptions of their own intelligence influence their experience in active learning science classes and consequently their social integration in college.  I also determined factors of active learning classrooms and instructor behaviors that can affect whether students experience positive or negative social integration in the context of active learning.  I found that students’ hidden identities, such as the LGBTQIA identity, are more relevant in active learning classes where students work together and that the increased relevance of one’s identity can have a positive and negative impact on their social integration.  I also found that students’ identities can predict their academic self-concept, or their perception of their intelligence as it compares to others’ intelligence in biology, which in turn predicts their participation in small group-discussion.  While many students express a fear of negative evaluation, or dread being evaluated negatively by others when speaking out in active learning classes, I identified that how instructors structure group work can cause students to feel more or less integrated into the college science classroom.  Lastly, I identified tools that instructors can use, such as name tents and humor, which can positive affect students’ social integration into the college science classroom.  In sum, I highlight inequities in students’ experiences in active learning science classrooms and the mechanisms that underlie some of these inequities.  I hope this work can be used to create more inclusive undergraduate active learning science courses.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Biology 201},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the exploratory factor analyses done on instruments measuring perceived racism/racial discrimination using guidelines from experts in psychometric theory. The techniques used for factor analysis were reviewed and critiqued and the adequacy of reporting was evaluated. Internet search engines and four electronic abstract databases were used to identify 16 relevant instruments that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Principal component analysis was the most frequent method of extraction (81\%). Sample sizes were adequate for factor analysis in 81 percent of studies. The majority of studies reported appropriate criteria for the acceptance of un-rotated factors (81\%) and justified the rotation method (75\%). Exactly 94 percent of studies reported partially acceptable criteria for the acceptance of rotated factors. The majority of articles (69\%) reported adequate coefficient alphas for the resultant subscales. In 81 percent of the studies, the conceptualized dimensions were supported by factor analysis.},

Thus, to start with, this article aims to fill this gap by identifying the possible bases in existing laws that may, at least in principle, justify claims of unlawful behaviour. As far as ethical considerations are concerned, the article then notes a deep divide between those who fully endorse the notion of cultural appropriation and those who are resolutely opposed to it. This article aims to give fair consideration to both sides of the argument, suggesting three categories of potentially unethical conduct. On this basis, the article finally revisits possible legal responses from a normative perspective.},

Political theory, in particular, has been largely silent about cultural appropriation. Such silence is strange considering that cultural appropriation is clearly linked to key concepts in political theory such as culture, recognition, and redistribution. In this paper, I utilize political theory to advance a harm-based account of cultural appropriation. I argue that there are three potential harms with cultural appropriation: (1) nonrecognition, (2) misrecognition, and (3) exploitation. Discerning whether these harms are present or absent offers a means of placing specific instances of cultural appropriation on a spectrum of harmfulness. I conclude by considering how cultural appropriation, and associated appropriative harms, may be avoided.},

Data related to the men’s experiences is the article’s focus. Key themes from the data include: 1) men’s motivations for engagement; 2) men’s self-understandings as ‘champions for change’ 3) the barriers/risks associated with male championship; and 4) men’s evolving perceptions and critiques of the male champions model. Findings show that men demonstrated personal growth and increased awareness through their participation in the pilot. Yet, their frustration with how equity and diversity was managed in their organisational context highlights pitfalls in the concept of a male ‘champion’.

The chapter is a contribution to the debates concerning the considerable impact of identity construction on learning, and the construction of ‘science-identity’ in particular. With this in mind, we examine the central issues in the light of the teaching and learning of science in schools and universities, as well as in the population at large.},

The authors drew on London and associates' STEM Engagement Framework to determine what factors are related to remaining in the program through the first two years. Results indicate that having a high scientific identity and reporting fewer instances of discrimination increased the likelihood of remaining in the program. Black students were somewhat more likely than the other underrepresented racially minoritized (URM) groups to remain in the program and were as likely as non-URM participants to remain enrolled in the program.},

To test the hypothesis that active learning disproportionately benefits URM students, we quantified the effects of traditional versus active learning on student academic performance, science self-efficacy, and sense of social belonging in a large (more than 250 students) introductory STEM course. A transition to active learning closed the gap in learning gains between non-URM and URM students and led to an increase in science self-efficacy for all students. Sense of social belonging also increased significantly with active learning, but only for non-URM students. Through structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that, for URM students, the increase in self-efficacy mediated the positive effect of active-learning pedagogy on two metrics of student performance. Our results add to a growing body of research that supports varied and inclusive teaching as one pathway to a diversified STEM workforce.},

Based on data from various national and international large-scale assessments, the volume provides a better understanding of both the functions and foundations of the Nordic model, along with how the concepts mentioned above are enacted in practice. Across the chapters, data from different national and international large-scale assessment studies are used for cross- and single-country analyses on a variety of issues related to equity, equality and inequality in diverse educational settings. The investigations address different subject domains (i.e., mathematics, science, reading), age and grade groups, but also issues related to teachers and the schools themselves. In addition to these empirical chapters, the book addresses the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of the ideas and tools embedded in the phenomena of equity and equality and how they have met in the Nordic model of education.},

The corpus of data for this study includes student-authored self-reflective essays about our diversity-focused learning outcome and focus-group interviews with current and former students. Drawing on Eisenberg’s concept of strategic ambiguity and Freire’s notion of the banking model of education, we suggest that engaging students in dialogues about diversity-focused learning outcomes may help students understand both how and why to accomplish those outcomes. This study offers an entry point for discussing ways in which we present, implement, teach, and assess our learning outcomes about diversity in communication studies.},

This study qualitatively explored descriptions and depictions of identities and aspects of self among a group of LGBTQ-identified emerging adults. Findings suggest that emerging adults' uses of socially constructed identities are contextually specific, intersectional, and make use of agency. In addition, participants identified aspects of themselves that they saw as emerging from and existing in relation to their LGBTQ-specific identities. These identities are used to resist the social stigma and limitations placed on them as LGBTQ-identified young people, and may serve as sources of resilience.},

This exploration demonstrates that inclusion rather than being located in terms of equality should actually be observed as a complex ideological construct which legitimised the process of the subordination and domination of vulnerable groups in our society. In the article it is argued that whilst supposing to ensure the presence of all children, on their terms, in mainstream schools, inclusion in this guise only insinuated itself in-the-place-of integration and thereby operated as a continuous and homogeneous reparation and modification of presence in the representation of children with special educational needs and/or disabilities. The article concludes therefore that inclusion became located as a ‘guise of truth’ which employed a cultural cloak of equality to create double binds where performativity was pitched against presence, standards against segregation and ablism against absence.},

The purpose of this article was to integrate the literature on marginalization and situate the concept in the framework of social determinants of health. We demonstrate that social position links marginalization and social determinants of health. This perspective provides a critical lens to assess the societal power dynamics that influence the construction of the socio-environmental factors affecting health.

Such pedagogies undermine long-standing geographic knowledge systems that marginalize and misrepresent people of color while also distorting and misinforming the worldviews of a White society. Drawing from classroom successes and uncertainties, five educators explore the anti-racist possibilities of geography education as a form of “regional storytelling.” Regions, one of geography’s formative constructs, play a central role within popular and academic understandings of racial differences and identities. Making exclusionary moral judgements about regions and associated populations has long been at the core of the colonization and racialization process. Contributors use reflexive storytelling – understood here as both a classroom instructional method and a way to create supportive spaces for educators to reflect on their praxis – to identify and discuss strategies for carrying out anti-racist, regionally-based teaching, the instructional decisions and challenges faced in the classroom, and perceptions of student response and anxieties. We also reflect on how the wider regional and racial positionalities of teachers and students shape the way an anti-racist pedagogy is enacted, interpreted, and realized within the higher education classroom.},

And still today, the dream or demand of a cultural "melting pot" circulates through academia, policy institutions, and mainstream media outlets. Noting society’s many exclusions and erasures, scholars in the second half of the twentieth century persuasively argued that only some social groups assimilate. Others, they pointed out, are subject to racialization.  In this bold, discipline-traversing cultural history, Catherine Ramírez develops an entirely different account of assimilation. Weaving together the legacies of US settler colonialism, slavery, and border control, Ramírez challenges the assumption that racialization and assimilation are separate and incompatible processes. In fascinating chapters with subjects that range from nineteenth century boarding schools to the contemporary artwork of undocumented immigrants, this book decouples immigration and assimilation and probes the gap between assimilation and citizenship. It shows that assimilation is not just a process of absorption and becoming more alike. Rather, assimilation is a process of racialization and subordination and of power and inequality.},

	abstract = {An incisive look at how America’s continued demographic explosion has spurred the development of a new identity as people of color.  For decades now, pundits and political scientists have been pointing to a major demographic change that’s underway in the United States. Demographers project that whites will become a minority of the US population and that minority groups will jointly comprise a majority before 2050.  Diversity’s Child appraises the political ramifications of this change. Efrén O. Pérez deftly argues that America’s changing demographics are forging a new identity for many as people of color—that unifies the political outlook of assorted minority groups. Drawing on opinion surveys of multiple minority groups, social science experiments with minority adults, content analyses of newspapers and congressional archives, and in-depth interviews with minority individuals, Pérez makes two key points. First, a person of color's identity does exist, and we can reliably measure it, as well as distinguish it from other identities that minorities hold. Second, across a wide swath of circumstances, identifying as a person of color profoundly shapes how minorities view themselves and their political system. Diversity’s Child is a vital and engaging look at America’s identity politics as well as at how people of color think about racial disparities and how politics can best solve them.},

This paper is a contribution to the conceptual delineation regarding the racism and other phenomena associated with it, such as ethnocentrism and xenophobia, focusing especially on the term of ‘cultural racism’. After outlining a framework for defining this term and depicting the main features of racialist thinking processes, such as essentialization, reductionism and absolutization, the paper gives particular attention to the discussions regarding the question if cultural racism is a new form of the ‘classical’, biological racism, or represents a different phenomenon, and this would be the reason why, in the scientific discourse, there should be used another, more adequate term, which should replace the problematic word ‘racism’. The main arguments of the theoretical perspectives which sustain each answer are presented, thus highlighting the key aspects of the contemporary racism. Furthermore some remarks are made regarding the approach and research of this phenomenon and it is emphasized that emergent questions require further investigation both for the theoretical development and the practical application and anti-racist strategies.},

This integrative scoping review examines the strength of these publications, then synthesizes their findings to provide a global perspective on xenophobia. The results show that it is not merely a political threat, but also has real, negative impact on the health of individuals and their communities. Given the multiple negative effects on individual and community health, xenophobia warrants more attention from both a public health and political perspective. Policies that promote cultural integration and understanding are essential to improving community health.},

This article represents an initial contribution toward that effort. Through comparison with Omi and Winant’s (1994) Racial State Theory (RST), I identify six central tenets – racialization of the state; state as white institutional space; instrumentalism; interest-convergence; fluid boundaries; and permanent racist orientation – that characterize the CRT of State for the United States. I close by entertaining three questions Omi and Winant (2012) argue demonstrate the utility of RST and use them to illustrate where the CRT of State I outline achieves greater analytical purchase than RST.},

Thus far, scholarly debates about what constitutes a diaspora continue to thrive. In this article, I approach this conceptual divide inductively, by analysing how scholars identify and discuss the defining features of diaspora. I have constructed a database that consists of highly cited articles in the social sciences and the humanities that define diaspora. Using ATLAS.ti, a qualitative data analysis software, I coded and aggregated the most prevalent attributes of diaspora in those definitions. The features that appear in at least half of the definitions are dispersal or immigration, location outside a homeland, community, orientation to a homeland, transnationalism, and group identity. These attributes provided me with the foundation to offer a clear, comprehensive, and workable definition of diaspora.},

In this review, we highlight examples of historically derived ideas and cultural patterns that maintain present-day racial inequalities. We discuss three key insights on the psychology of racism derived from utilizing a cultural-psychology framework. First, one can find racism embedded in our everyday worlds. Second, through our preferences and selections, we maintain racialized contexts in everyday action. Third, we inhabit cultural worlds that, in turn, promote racialized ways of seeing, being in, and acting in the world. This perspective directs attempts at intervention away from individual tendencies and instead focuses on changing the structures of mind in context that reflect and reproduce racial domination.},

The authors hope that by providing readers with a basic understanding of oppression it will motivate them to combat bias to create a more just, harmonious, and healthy world.Highlights include:Introduces readers to the psychological theories and research on oppression whereas most other books focus on a sociological or ethnic studies perspective.Introduces readers to the fundamentals of oppression--what it is, who experiences it, and where and when it has taken place.Dissects the layers of oppression -- how it is expressed blatantly or subtly and overtly or covertly.Explores how oppression is manifested on different levels including interpersonal, institutional/systemic, and internalized, for a deeper understanding.Demonstrates how oppression influences peoples’ thoughts, attitudes, feelings, and behaviors, and how it influences peoples’ well-being and health.Explores why certain people are discriminated against simply because of their race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality and the resulting psychological implications.Highlights what researchers and service providers are doing to address oppression via encouraging community and clinical interventions.Examines why oppression exists and has persisted throughout history and what it looks like today.Recommends future psychological work on oppression across research, clinical, and community contexts.Ideal as a text in upper level undergraduate and beginning graduate courses on oppression, prejudice and discrimination, race relations, ethnic studies, ethnic and racial minorities, multicultural or cross-cultural psychology, multicultural counseling, diversity, women’s studies, LGBT studies, disability studies, and social justice taught in psychology, social work, and counseling. Behavioral and mental health providers in both clinical and community contexts will also appreciate this book.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-266035-0},
	abstract = {Stereotypes sometimes lead us to make poor judgements of other people, but they also have the potential to facilitate quick, efficient, and accurate judgements. How can we discern whether any individual act of stereotyping will have the positive or negative effect? How Stereotypes Deceive Us addresses this question. It identifies various factors that determine whether or not the application of a stereotype to an individual in a specific context will facilitate or impede correct judgements and perceptions of the individual. It challenges the thought that stereotyping only and always impedes correct judgement when the stereotypes that are applied are inaccurate, failing to reflect social realities. It argues instead that stereotypes that reflect social realities can lead to misperceptions and misjudgements, and that inaccurate but egalitarian social attitudes can therefore facilitate correct judgements and accurate perceptions. The arguments presented in this book have important implications for those who might engage in stereotyping and those who are at risk of being stereotyped. They have implications for those who work in healthcare and those who have mental health conditions. How Stereotypes Deceive Us provides a new conceptual framework-evaluative dispositionalism-that captures the epistemic faults of stereotypes and stereotyping, providing conceptual resources that can be used to improve our own thinking by avoiding the pitfalls of stereotyping, and to challenge other people's stereotyping where it is likely to lead to misperception and misjudgement.},

Tokenism is defined as the practice of making perfunctory or symbolic efforts to engage communities or patients.We wanted to explore how tokenism might influence engaging patients in research to help researchers work towards more genuine engagement.The Community Clinician Advisory Group and Patient and Clinician Engagement program held a workshop at the 2015 North American Primary Care Research Group meeting titled ‘How Do We Move beyond Tokenism in Patient Engagement?’ Patients, clinicians and academic researchers contributed examples of genuine and token engagement characteristics based on personal experience and knowledge. Data were iteratively collated and categorized into domains and items.Examples of genuine and token engagement were categorized into three domains: Methods/Structure of engagement, Intent and Relationship building. Members with experience in patient-engaged research projects felt that longitudinal engagement was a key element to effectively translating research into local community and practice.The group (i) highly valued genuine intent and relationship building as elements to combat tokenism; (ii) noted that early genuine attempts at engagement may superficially resemble tokenism as researchers build enduring and trusting relationships with patient/community partners and (iii) emphasized the importance of seeking and utilizing patient experiences throughout research. These observations may contribute to more formal methods to help researchers (and reviewers) evaluate where engagement processes sit along the ‘genuine–token’ continuum.},

	abstract = {Reparations are often considered victim-centred transitional justice measures. While they have their basis in private law notions of corrective justice and human rights principles of remedy, politics and economic resources often shape reparations in times of transition. Reparations in transitional justice often take time and require revisiting as society becomes conscious of previously hidden or marginalised victims. Added to this is the challenge of delimiting who are eligible, contested victimhood, and when does the transition end. This raises questions of whether reparations are appropriate for historical violations caused by colonial governments or slavery. The chapter examines individual and collective reparations, apportionment amongst family members, reparation processes and mechanisms, as well as evidential and financial concerns. Although public resources may be limited in provided full compensatory awards to all victims, small sums or pensions along with public acknowledgement of victims’ suffering, wrongfulness of the perpetrators and institutions’ acts, along with guarantees of non-repetition can be ‘good enough’. This chapter argues that despite the political wrangling of reparations during transition, the right to reparations in international law reflects the necessity of states delivering reparations to victims of serious violations.},

Referring to the defensive moves that white people make when challenged racially, white fragility is characterized by emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and by behaviors including argumentation and silence. These behaviors, in turn, function to reinstate white racial equilibrium and prevent any meaningful cross-racial dialogue. In this in-depth exploration, DiAngelo examines how white fragility develops, how it protects racial inequality, and what we can do to engage more constructively.},

The authors’ prescription is threefold, beginning with a call for intersectional health studies and reports that avoid one-dimensional misrepresentations of widespread health problems as simply Black or White problems. Second, there is the need for a “critical consciousness” about race and class.

Awareness of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) in the UK has risen over the past decade, in part due to high profile of EDS patient organisations and the EDS National Diagnostic Service commissioned in 2009. Significant advances in genetic testing have culminated in the publication of a new international classification in 2017 with 13 types identified.1 Clinicians will see an increasing number of patients, some of whom will suspect a diagnosis of EDS themselves. 

This article is intended to support non-specialist clinicians to consider the diagnosis of this group of conditions in appropriate patients. It discusses the features of the different types of EDS and explains how clinicians can expect their patients to be managed in secondary care.

\#\#\# How this article was created

The authors are members of the International Consortium on Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and Related Disorders and participated in literature searches used for the basis of the articles written on the new classification of EDS published in 2017. The authors have more than 10 years’ experience of EDS patient consultations and data collection in the highly specialised EDS service.

Fromthen on, the eponym ‘Asperger’s syndrome’ increasingly gainedcurrency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to theconceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact thatAsperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Viennacaused some controversy regarding his potential ties to NationalSocialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidencewas scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as anactive opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goalof this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is basedto a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and ona small segment of his published work.},

Clinical trials of medications for ADHD have been largely short-term and have predominantly involved young and middle-aged adults. Data are lacking on long-term benefits and risks and on risks among elderly patients. The absolute risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events associated with ADHD medications appears to be very low. However, the observed increases in pulse rate and blood pressure with stimulant use underscore the need for caution in prescribing these agents for patients with cardiovascular disease. The risk of addiction to stimulant medications prescribed for the treatment of ADHD in adults is low, but the clinician should be aware of their potential for abuse and dependence.},

Understanding the term, and its usefulness to some individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, will benefit adult educators and provide strategies to avoid audism in adult education environments.},

The clinical features of this entity evolve over time and the specific CP syndrome may be recognizable only after 3–5 y of age; although suggestive signs and symptoms may be present at an earlier age. The management involves neurological rehabilitation (addressing muscle tonal abnormalities, and devising physical and occupational therapies) and diagnosis and management of co-morbidities (including epilepsy, impairment of cognition, vision, hearing, and disturbances of growth and gastrointestinal function). The management, therefore, is multidisciplinary involving the treating physician working with a team of rehabilitation-, orthopedic-, psychologic-, and social care- providers.},

Providing access to a natural sign language supports this goal. Despite evidence that natural sign languages are beneficial to DHH children, many researchers and practitioners advise families to focus exclusively on spoken language. We critique the Pediatrics article ‘Early Sign Language Exposure and Cochlear Implants’ (Geers et al., 2017) as an example of research that makes unsupported claims against the inclusion of natural sign languages. We refute claims that (1) there are harmful effects of sign language and (2) that listening and spoken language are necessary for optimal development of deaf children. While practical challenges remain (and are discussed) for providing a sign language-rich environment, research evidence suggests that such challenges are worth tackling in light of natural sign languages providing a host of benefits for DHH children – especially in the prevention and reduction of language deprivation.},

As such, the CI is now widely regarded as one of the great advances in modern medicine. This article reviews the key events and discoveries that led up to the current CI systems, and we review and present some among the many possibilities for further improvements in device design and performance. The past achievements include: (1) development of reliable devices that can be used over the lifetime of a patient; (2) development of arrays of implanted electrodes that can stimulate more than one site in the cochlea; and (3) progressive and large improvements in sound processing strategies for CIs. In addition, cooperation between research organizations and companies greatly accelerated the widespread availability and use of safe and effective devices. Possibilities for the future include: (1) use of otoprotective drugs; (2) further improvements in electrode designs and placements; (3) further improvements in sound processing strategies; (4) use of stem cells to replace lost sensory hair cells and neural structures in the cochlea; (5) gene therapy; (6) further reductions in the trauma caused by insertions of electrodes and other manipulations during implant surgeries; and (7) optical rather electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Each of these possibilities is the subject of active research. Although great progress has been made to date in the development of the CI, including the first substantial restoration of a human sense, much more progress seems likely and certainly would not be a surprise.

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy \textit{per se} carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

The standing height is measured from ground to the vertex when the head is in the Frankfurt-horizontal plane. Most people have an aversion to the term dwarf and identify themselves as "Little people" and also have a community under the name -'Little People of America'. Dwarfism is broadly categorized into two types based on the patient's physical appearance, which are: proportionate short stature (PSS) and disproportionate short stature (DSS). Proportionate short stature (PSS), as the name suggests, means that the limbs and the trunk are proportionately small. Whereas, disproportionate short stature (DSS) implies that the individual has a significant difference in their sitting and standing height, and either their trunk or extremities are small. The child's assessment and evaluation aim to identify the pathological causes of short stature and intervene accordingly.},

	abstract = {Chronic illnesses are conditions that persist for an extended amount of time, typically have an unforeseeable cure and can greatly impact an individual's life. Diseases that were previously responsible for large rates of mortality, such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis, are now considered treatable conditions, posing generally only minor threats in developed countries, instead, there are increased numbers of individuals living long term with conditions such as heart disease, cancer, HIV and diabetes. Advances to medical technology and early detection, in addition to an ageing population, means that more people are living longer with chronic conditions. Not only does this result in an increased burden for health care, but it also establishes the importance of understanding how individuals cope and adjust to living long term with a chronic illness. Adjusting to a diagnosis requires changes across psychological, social and physical aspects of the individual's life. The way that an individual copes with chronic illness effects subsequent psychological and physical outcomes. The process of coping is influenced by a number of factors, including illness perceptions, social support, personality and demographic variables. A number of successful intervention strategies have recently been developed for patients suffering from chronic illness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Tourette syndrome is a common neurodevelopmental disorder defined by characteristic involuntary movements, tics, with both motor and phonic components. Tourette syndrome is usually conceptualized as a basal ganglia disorder, with an emphasis on striatal dysfunction. While considerable evidence is consistent with these concepts, imaging data suggest diffuse functional and structural abnormalities in Tourette syndrome brain. Tourette syndrome exhibits features that are difficult to explain solely based on basal ganglia circuit dysfunctions. These features include the natural history of tic expression, with typical onset of tics around ages 5 to 7 years and exacerbation during the peri-pubertal years, marked sex disparity with higher male prevalence, and the characteristic distribution of tics. The latter are usually repetitive, somewhat stereotyped involuntary eye, facial and head movements, and phonations. A major functional role of eye, face, and head movements is social signalling. Prior work in social neuroscience identified a phylogenetically conserved network of sexually dimorphic subcortical nuclei, the Social Behaviour Network, mediating many social behaviours. Social behaviour network function is modulated developmentally by gonadal steroids and social behaviour network outputs are stereotyped sex and species specific behaviours. In 2011 O’Connell and Hofmann proposed that the social behaviour network interdigitates with the basal ganglia to form a greater network, the social decision-making network. The social decision-making network may have two functionally complementary limbs: the basal ganglia component responsible for evaluation of socially relevant stimuli and actions with the social behaviour network component responsible for the performance of social acts. Social decision-making network dysfunction can explain major features of the neurobiology of Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome may be a disorder of social communication resulting from developmental abnormalities at several levels of the social decision-making network. The social decision-making network dysfunction hypothesis suggests new avenues for research in Tourette syndrome and new potential therapeutic targets.},

	doi = {10.1080/15532739.2018.1426074},
	abstract = {Background: Emerging research and colloquial dialogues increasingly point to an uptick in non-binary gender identity endorsement, however research has failed to parallel this increase. For example, existing literature often conflates gender identity with sexual orientation, lumping TGNC people under the LGBTQ umbrella, thus rendering the “T” silent in the process. Further, extant research adheres to a binary (i.e., dichotomous male/female) conceptualization of gender, thus excluding individuals who identify as genderqueer, gender non-conforming, or otherwise non-binary as well as those who do not identify with the construct of gender at all (e.g., agender)., Method: This qualitative investigation utilized individual interviews with 15 TGNC adults. Data analysis employed two data-driven phases, first identifying themes consistent across the 15 transcripts to identify nuances in TGNC identity formation often missed by theory-driven models and second, establishing similarities and differences between binary and non-binary narratives., Results: Results indicated that various helpful and challenging factors played a stronger role than chronology, physical transition, or activism across all participants which contrasts findings in extant literature. Further, while binary and non-binary narratives were similar in many regards, several noteworthy distinctions emerged. For example, the concepts of “passing or blending”, intersections of gender identity with sexual orientation, and navigating identity presentation and disclosure were described differently for binary and non-binary participants., Conclusions: Historically, the “T” in “LGBTQ” has often been rendered silent. These results indicate that non-binary narratives have been rendered doubly silent. Given the increasing preponderance of non-binary identifications and the unique needs and experiences of non-binary participants, it is crucial that professional and lay communities alike begin to take two steps moving forward: 1) explicitly acknowledge the existence of non-binary TGNC identities and 2) work to achieve fluency regarding the unique needs and experiences of this population.},

	abstract = {Background Gender euphoria is an important experience and concept for many, especially transgender and/or nonbinary individuals, but has not received much attention from psychological and clinical research. In contrast to gender dysphoria, which originates in psychiatry, the term “gender euphoria” has been mobilized by some LGBTQ people to describe the powerfully positive emotions that can come from one’s gender/sex. As such, researchers and clinicians may benefit from conceptual clarity as to what gender euphoria is and what kinds of experiences might result in gender euphoria.Aim We aimed to better understand how trans community members and others conceptualize the term “gender euphoria,” including its relationship to gender dysphoria, as well as the contexts and behaviors that elicit gender euphoria.Method We administered an online qualitative survey to participants (N = 47) of diverse sexualities and gender/sexes (including transgender, cisgender, and/or nonbinary participants) who had heard of or used the term “gender euphoria.” Participants answered open-ended questions about where they had heard the term being used, how they would define gender euphoria and gender dysphoria, the relation between these terms, and their gender euphoric experiences.Results Analyses resulted in five themes: (1) gender euphoria describes a joyful feeling of rightness in one’s gender/sex, (2) gender euphoric experiences can be external, internal, and/or social, (3) “gender euphoria” originated in and circulates in online and in-person gender/sex minority communities, (4) dysphoria describes a negative feeling of conflict between gender/sexed aspects of one’s self, and (5) the relationship between euphoria and dysphoria is complex.Discussion These results can inform qualitative and quantitative research, gender affirmative clinical practice, political fights for transgender rights, and understandings of gendered experiences for people of all identities.},

	abstract = {Gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy, “top” (e.g., chest reconstruction surgery) and “bottom” (e.g., vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, metoidioplasty, etc.) surgeries, and puberty blockers, is an efficacious treatment of gender dysphoria for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals. However, many TGNC people encounter significant barriers in accessing gender-affirming care, which we detail via results from on online study. Participants included 256 TGNC individuals (78.9\% White, ages 16–73, Mage=28.4). Among participants, 61.3\% were receiving hormone therapy, 22.7\% had undergone top surgery, and 5.5\% had undergone bottom surgery. Open-ended responses (n=201) were thematically analyzed and common barriers included finances and insurance issues, a lack of service availability, and fears or worries. Participants reported various systemic issues and incidents of bias within medical and mental health fields, as well as a lack of medical provider awareness and education. Other themes were interpersonal barriers (e.g., fears of rejection); age and need of parental consent for minors; other medical issues; and a lack of information about how to acquire care. These findings can be utilized to educate professionals in medical and mental health fields about barriers their TGNC patients may encounter in receiving affirming care, and suggest a number of ways to improve access to these services.},

For both femininity and masculinity, the domains of "physical differences related to sex" and "emphasized physical differences" emerged. For masculinity, additional domains were: "activities and interests focused on the body," "powerful or oriented toward power," and "emotion-control or emotionally-limited." For femininity, additional domains were "lacking power," "orientation to other people," and "emotional." We then compared the characteristics/behaviors and domains we discovered to gender inventories that are commonly used in the contemporary period. The masculine domains focused on physical differences, activities, and interests that emerged from the present study are mostly absent from these masculinity inventories. The domains focused on power and restricted emotion are evident in these inventories, but these inventories do not cover all of the characteristics within our domains. The feminine domains that emerged from the present study are more often covered in these inventories, but some of the specific feminine characteristics we found are not evident in these inventories. Results are discussed in terms of gender role theory, gender inequality, and potential application for qualitative and quantitative inquiries into the construction of gender.},

The taxonomic framework proposed in this chapter is designed to assist the understanding of androgyny by specifying the variations in conceptions of androgyny and personality processes that underlay research in the field. The focus is on processes involved in information processing, such as perception, attention, categorization, memory, etc. The major issue for androgyny research is construct validation and the proposed taxonomic framework serves as one organizing schema for that process. As the taxonomic framework makes clear, there are a variety of possible personality processes involved in the development and expression of androgyny. Detailing conceptual and methodological differences within the androgyny literature serves to highlight theoretical and measurement inconsistencies in some studies.},

Data were collected online from 76 TNB individuals. Based on responses to two open-ended prompts, a two-tiered analysis was conducted. First, thematic analysis was used to develop four central themes describing the way TNB individuals conceptualized their androgynous body ideal: 1) Attaining Neutrality and De-Categorizing Gender; 2) Disaggregating Gender Expression; 3) Managing Gender Dysphoria; and 4) Achieving Authenticity. Second, content analysis was used to document 12 behaviors engaged in or actions taken for the purpose of approaching or maintaining an androgynous or non-stereotypical body ideal. These were grouped into 3 main categories: gender expression (clothes, hair, make-up, body modifications), body shape (weight, muscularity, eating/diet), and sex characteristics (hormone therapy, body hair, vocal, chest, genitals). Results of the present study expand the current body ideal literature by including TNB narratives and by focusing specifically on the ways an androgynous body ideal is conceptualized and maintained. Research and clinical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {First characterized by Kinsey in 1948, asexuality can be broadly defined as an absence of sexual attraction, with approximately 1\% of the population identifying as asexual. While asexuality research has flourished recently, very few papers have investigated the unique mechanism of romantic attraction in asexual people, notably that some experience romantic attraction (romantic asexual) while others do not (aromantic asexual). This study compared romantic and aromantic asexual individuals through secondary data analysis on demographic, behavioral, psychological, and physiological measures as the primary objective and compared asexual people to allosexual people on some measures as a secondary aim. After combining data from seven previous asexuality studies (n = 4032 total), we found that 74.0\% of asexual people reported experiencing romantic attraction. No significant difference was found in distribution of men and women between the aromantic and romantic asexual groups, though the asexual group showed higher proportions of women and non-binary genders compared to the allosexual comparison group. Romantic asexual participants reported a diverse range of romantic orientations, with only 36.0\% reporting a heteroromantic orientation, compared to 76.2\% of allosexual participants. As predicted, romantic asexual individuals were more likely to have been in a relationship when completing the survey, reported more past romantic and sexual partners and more frequent kissing than aromantic asexual people, and experienced more partner-oriented sexual desire than the aromantic asexual group. There were also differences in personality as romantic asexual people were less cold, more nurturant, and more intrusive than the aromantic asexual group. No difference was seen between romantic and aromantic asexual individuals in demographic characteristics, likelihood of having children, solitary sexual desire, physiological sexual functioning, frequencies of masturbation and sexual fantasy, or depression. These similarities and differences between romantic and aromantic asexual people highlight the diversity within the asexual community.},

Results of a cross-sectional study (N = 447, 61.8\% women; Mage = 24.62, SD = 6.98) showed that endorsing asexuality as a lack of sexual desire was associated with less experience with romantic partners, more experience with intimate affective relationships, more sex averse attitudes, and avoidant attachment. Sexual attraction was associated with more experience with romantic partners, less experience with intimate romantic and affective relationships, and more sex favorable attitudes. Romantic attraction was associated with more experience with romantic partners, less experience with intimate romantic relationships, and anxious attachment. Desire to establish intimate romantic relationships was associated with more experience with romantic partners, more sex favorable attitudes, and anxious attachment. Lastly, desire to establish intimate affective relationships was associated with more experience with affective relationships and anxious attachment. This study highlights the need to acknowledge diversity within the ace community by showing the importance of past experiences and individual differences in shaping the way ace individuals construe their identity and their relationships.},

Large samples capable of demonstrating variation within the transgender and gender diverse (TGD) community can inform intervention efforts to improve health equity. A population-based sample of TGD youth was used to examine associations between perceived gender presentation, bullying victimization, and emotional distress using two data analysis approaches.

Methods: This secondary data analysis of the Minnesota Student Survey included 2168 9th and 11th graders who identified as “transgender, genderqueer, genderfluid, or unsure about their gender identity.” Youth reported their biological sex, how others perceived their gender presentation, experiences of four forms of bullying victimization, and four measures of emotional distress. Logistic regression and multifactor analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare and contrast two analysis approaches.

Results: Logistic regressions indicated that TGD youth perceived as more gender incongruent had higher odds of bullying victimization and emotional distress relative to those perceived as very congruent with their biological sex. Multifactor ANOVAs demonstrated more variable patterns and allowed for comparisons of each perceived presentation group with all other groups, reflecting nuances that exist within TGD youth.

Conclusion: Researchers should adopt data analysis strategies that allow for comparisons of all perceived gender presentation categories rather than assigning a reference group. Those working with TGD youth should be particularly attuned to youth perceived as gender incongruent as they may be more likely to experience bullying victimization and emotional distress.},

	abstract = {Background: Recently, a multitude of terms have emerged, especially within North America and Western Europe, which describe identities that are not experienced within the culturally accepted binary structure of gender which prevails within those cultures. As yet, there is no clear single umbrella term to describe such identities and a mixture of words have been used in scholarly work to date., Aims: To explore the origins and track the emergence of newer terms and definitions for identities between, outside and beyond the gender binary, to outline current trends in descriptors within scholarly work and to suggest a term which is wide enough to encompass all identities., Methods: A comprehensive systematic review was made, following the PRISMA guidelines. Several relevant key terms were used to search Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and the International Journal of Transgenderism. The descriptions each title gives for identities outside of the binary are extracted for analysis., Results: Several terms have been used over the years to describe identities outside of the binary. “Non-binary” and “genderqueer” are currently mostly used as umbrella terms. However, “gender diverse” is emerging as a more suitable wide-ranging inclusive term for non-male and non-female identities., Discussion: Identity outside of “male” and “female” is an emerging concept which currently has several identifiers and little academic agreement on which is the most pertinent. The two leading descriptors are “non-binary” and “genderqueer.” Gender diverse is emerging as a new term which has the aim of including all other terms outside of male and female within it and this article suggests the increase in its use to describe gender identities outside of the binary.},

	abstract = {This chapter starts with a historical overview of biological explanations of the nature of women and differences between the sexes, followed by definitions of biological determinism and essentialism. Recent and contemporary manifestations of biological determinism, primarily centering on genes, hormones, and the brain, are discussed and criticized. Essentialist theories about male–female differences are outlined along with the feminist response to them. After a review of the status of biological and essentialist approaches to sexual orientation, new perspectives on the role of biology are highlighted, including nondeterministic and nonessentialist ways of incorporating the body into approaches to theorizing human nature and difference. The persistence of biological determinism and essentialism, despite decades of criticism, is noted, leading to the conclusion that the need for critique and resistance to these outmoded ways of thinking persists.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder is a construct used to describe individuals with a specific combination of impairments in social communication and repetitive behaviours, highly restricted interests and/or sensory behaviours beginning early in life. The worldwide prevalence of autism is just under 1\%, but estimates are higher in high-income countries. Although gross brain pathology is not characteristic of autism, subtle anatomical and functional differences have been observed in post-mortem, neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies. Initially, it was hoped that accurate measurement of behavioural phenotypes would lead to specific genetic subtypes, but genetic findings have mainly applied to heterogeneous groups that are not specific to autism. Psychosocial interventions in children can improve specific behaviours, such as joint attention, language and social engagement, that may affect further development and could reduce symptom severity. However, further research is necessary to identify the long-term needs of people with autism, and treatments and the mechanisms behind them that could result in improved independence and quality of life over time. Families are often the major source of support for people with autism throughout much of life and need to be considered, along with the perspectives of autistic individuals, in both research and practice.
Autism spectrum disorder — or autism — is a neurodevelopmental disorder that typically manifests in young children. This Primer by Lord and colleagues reviews the epidemiology, mechanisms, clinical detection and treatment of autism.},
