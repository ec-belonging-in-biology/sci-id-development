# Development of Scientific Identity (Sci-ID) in Underrepresented Populations in the Undergraduate Setting at Emmanuel College, Boston

**_Purpose:_** The materials contained within this GitHub repository, `sci-id-development`, are developed in aims of nurturing the scientific identity of underrepresented undergraduate biology, chemistry, and computer science students. The materials fall within two domains: (1) instructional resources, including a glossary of literature-derived recommended terms, a set of research-identified recommended practices, and an index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists and (2) evaluation materials, including a comprehensive demographic survey, a Sci-ID quantification instrument, and a study design. As of November 2021, these materials are intended for the sole use of the Biology, Chemistry, and Data Science departments of Emmanuel College; these documents are undergoing review and validation and will change significantly in the coming months. As such, current releases are and will be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.
