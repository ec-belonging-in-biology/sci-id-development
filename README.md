# Development of Scientific Identity (Sci-ID) in Underrepresented Populations in the Undergraduate Setting at Emmanuel College, Boston

**_Purpose:_** The materials contained within this GitHub repository, `sci-id-development`, are developed in aims of nurturing the scientific identity of underrepresented undergraduate biology, chemistry, and computer science students. The materials fall within two domains: (1) instructional resources, including a glossary of literature-derived recommended terms, a set of research-identified recommended practices, and an index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists and (2) evaluation materials, including a comprehensive demographic survey, a Sci-ID quantification instrument, and a study design. As of November 2021, these materials are intended for the sole use of the Biology, Chemistry, and Data Science departments of Emmanuel College; these documents are undergoing review and validation and will change significantly in the coming months. As such, current releases are and will be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.


## Materials:

### Instruments:

#### Instrument 1: 👩‍🔬 [Quantification of Sci-ID (QoS)](instruments/QoS-quantification_of_Sci-ID.md)

The QoS instrument consists of several questions to measure a student's Sci-ID over its three domains -- self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and perception that science is useful -- and their cumulative effect.

#### Instrument 2: 🧭 [Qualitative Identity Inventory (QII)](instruments/QII-qualitative_identity_inventory.md)

The QII describes a comprehensive and accurate representation of their identity and determine which underrepresented identities they may possess including ability, race, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, reproductive ability, body size, campus involvement, parental status, place of birth, on campus housing status, immigrant status, language, and prior education and assesses the student’s effective privileges and power.
#### Instrument 3: 👩‍🏫 [Instructor Guideline Adherence Rating (IGAR)](instruments/IGAR-instructor_guideline_adherence_rating.md)

The IGAR instrument measures the adherence of an instructor to the recommended guidelines of the curriculum intervention. It is intended for both self-evaluation by an instructor and by an observer. Specifically, it evaluates the instructor's presentation of information and associated materials (e.g. slides, textbooks, handouts).
