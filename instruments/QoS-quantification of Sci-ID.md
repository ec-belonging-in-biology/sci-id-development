## ✍ Description

> The QoS instrument consists of several questions to measure a student's Sci-ID over its three domains -- self-efficacy, sense of belonging, and perception that science is useful -- and their cumulative effect.

## 📊 Metrics

A respondent's cumulative QoS is reported as a score from 0 to 100 composed of four sub scores, each ranging from 0 to 25.

| Score                         | Description                                                                                                   | Calculation                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Science self-efficacy         | Measures one's perceived self-confidence in their ability to do impactful science                             | Scores assigned to each response for each question are totaled and the summation is normalized to a 0 - 25 scale. |
| Sense of belonging in Science | Measures one's comfort in and perception that they fit into their environment, relationships, and involvement | Scores assigned to each response for each question are totaled and the summation is normalized to a 0 - 25 scale. |
| Perception of Science Utility | Measures one's attitudes and perceptions of how useful scientific applications are in their world             | Scores assigned to each response for each question are totaled and the summation is normalized to a 0 - 25 scale. |
| Effective Sci-ID              | Measures the impact and outcomes of one's Sci-ID                                                              | Scores assigned to each response for each question are totaled and the summation is normalized to a 0 - 25 scale. |
| Cumulative Sci-ID             | Measures one's overall Sci-ID, including both their perception and their impact in science                    | The four sub scores are summed.                                                                                   |
