## ✍ Description

> The IGAR instrument measures the adherence of an instructor to the recommended guidelines of the curriculum intervention. It is intended for both self-evaluation by an instructor and by an observer. Specifically, it evaluates the instructor's presentation of information and associated materials (e.g. slides, textbooks, handouts).

## 📊 Metrics

The IGAR rates the instructor on a scale from 0 to 100, 0 being no adherence, 100 being flawless adherence and is calculated from normalized scores form evaluations of the three domains of the intervention.

> Some responses may be "not applicable". In that case, the score we be normalized to the total potential score if the question were answered.
