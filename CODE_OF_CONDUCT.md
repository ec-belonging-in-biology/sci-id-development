# Sci-ID Development Code of Conduct

## üéØ Our Goal

Our top priority is to develop the scientific identity of all students in the STEM undergraduate setting. To do so, we must cultivate community in the classroom, but also on our repository. We need to maintain an environment that is:

* Safe
* And makes space to be:
  * Present
  * Listen intently and deeply
  * Offer opportunities for growth while not "fixing" one another
  * Comment without assumptions
  * Seek understanding 
  * Share your individual truth while being aware of the differences between you and others, even if you share similar identities
  * Turning to wonder and learning when things get difficult or uncomfortable

## üìö The Scope of our Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is not granularly comprehensive, but rather outlines general expectations and guidelines that should inform you, the participant, and us, the maintainers as to how one should conduct oneself when collaborating:
* At in-person events
* On our GitHub repository
* When communicating via other routes regarding our Sci-ID development work

## ‚öñÔ∏è Our Community Standards

These community standards are set forth in order to best achieve our goal for this project.

Participants are expected to:

* Remain empathetic and kind to one another
* Respect differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences
* Give and receive constructive criticism gracefully
* Accept responsibility, apologize, remedy their impact, and remain respectful when they make mistakes and then learn from them
* Make claims based upon cited evidence
* Act in interest of the whole community rather than the individual
* Advocate for others
* Prioritize the voices of those less privileged than them
* Report violations of the community standards to our maintainers
* Adhere to contributing guidelines

Participants are not expected to (participants can, though):

* Remain respectful when advocating for their own identity that has a lack of privilege
* Personally educate other participants past notifying them that they made a mistake

Participants are prohibited from:

* Making personal attacks against one another
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
* Using slurs*
* 'Doxing' or publishing others' private information, including but not limited to: contact information, identities, and assets
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual advances or attention of any kind
* Spamming the repository, participants, and/or maintainers
* Any actions that could reasonably be considered revoking power or making an unsafe environment for an individual less privileged than oneself
* Other actions that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

*We acknowledge several communities reclaim slurs as an act of regaining power, however, we are unable to verify that one is a member of a community, and thus prohibit all use of slurs.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Our Maintainers' Responsibilities

Our community leaders and repository maintainers are expected to:

* Approve, request changes for, edit, or reject changes, commits, issues, and all other contributions in efforts to maintain our goal and advance the project
* Clarify and enforce community standards
* Respond to violations of the community standards and behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, and/or harmful
* Moderate all contributions and notify individuals of violation with follow-up communication
* Impose sanctions as seen fit in alignment with our enforcement guidelines

## ü§ù Enforcement of our Code of Conduct

Community leaders and repository maintainers are expected to follow these guidelines, informed by restorative justice practices, for enforcing the code of conduct:

### 0. Immediate response

Community leaders and repository maintainers may not always have an immediate response, however, if they deem that there is a time-sensitive threat of harm, they may mute or remove a participant from the repository or eject a participant from an in-person event at their discretion.

### 1. Assess impact, intent, and any power dynamics

The impact and intent will be assessed for the incident, with impact taking priority. When an incident occurs, first the impact to the community and individuals will be determined followed by a determination of intent. This will be followed by an assessment of any present power dynamics between the participant who made the mistake and the participants and/or groups impacted. The incident's impact will select the sanction. Intent will be used to help inform the course of the sanction.

### 2. Corrective action

The impact will be mitigated by maintainers and leaders as effectively as possible. This may include an announcement or comment identifying the mistake and making a correction in a contribution. In some instances, this may result in the removal of a contribution.

### 3. Sanctions

Depending on the magnitude of the impact, any number of the following sanctions may be administered to a participant:

#### 3.1 Warning

**Impact**: An impact with a relatively low impact that does not cause any time-sensitive harm may be given a warning.

**Sanction**: A warning will be administered to the participant with a description of how they violated the code of conduct and a definition of further sanctions for continued behavior. Expectations that the participant corrects their contribution within 21 days of the warning being given will be established. The participant's correction will be guided and evaluated by leaders and/or maintainers and then approved, edited, or rejected. Failure to correct the contribution with 21 days may result in further sanctions and/or removal of the contribution.

#### 3.2 Temporary Ban

**Impact**: An impact with any degree of severity that may cause time-sensitive harm or a repeated impact with reasonably clear malintent may result in a temporary ban.

**Sanction**: A participant may receive a temporary ban from the repository and/or organization to prohibit them from making any further harmful contributions until they demonstrate a sufficient understanding of their impact, plan for correction, and are prepared to apologize. Participants temporarily banned will be notified officially via email by the leaders and/or maintainers in which their violation will be defined and guidance for remedy will be given. Sanctions for repeated harmful impacts will also be defined. The participant's harmful contribution may be removed until an adequate correction is made. Their reentry to the community and/or repository is at the discretion of the leaders and maintainers pending they deem the correction is reasonably adequate. A conduct meeting may also be required for reentry at the discretion of the leaders and maintainers

### 3.3 Permanent Ban

**Impact**: An impact that is severely harmful, consistent repeated impacts may, and/or no intent to correct their contribution may result in a permanent ban. Participants may or not be notified via email of their ban. Their contribution(s) will be removed as deemed appropriate by the leaders and maintainers.

### Sanction Appeals

Sanctions may be appealed by emailing a leader or maintainer. The leaders and/or maintainers will evaluate the appeal and may or may not provide a response. Appeals are required to state:

1. The participant's perception of their impact
2. Any reliable and verified sources pertinent to the incident
3. An explanation of why they disagree with their sanction and/or their indicated violation.

Failure to provide the required information will result in the dismissal of your appeal.
