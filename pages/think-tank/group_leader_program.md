# The Belonging in Bio Think Tank
*Tuesday, December 14th, 2021*

## Thank you!

Thank you so much for taking the time to participate in improving our STEM program here at Emmanuel and helping me get this event organized. You will find all relevant info in this document - you will likely refer to it frequently during your discussions.

# Tonight's activities

## 1. Meet with your group

Get to know the group of people you'll be having some important conversations with regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Please introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, class, and major.

## 2. Review our community code of conduct

Review the following and invite your group to establish any other guidelines they see fit:

* Remain empathetic and kind to one another
* Promote a safe environment for all
* And make space to:
  * Be present
  * Listen intently and deeply
  * Offer opportunities for growth while not "fixing" one another
  * Comment without assumptions
  * Seek understanding 
  * Share your individual truth while being aware of the differences between you and others, even if you share similar identities
  * Turn to wonder and learning when things get difficult or uncomfortable

## 3. Explore the project
Explain the following to your group:

The Scientific Identity (Sci-ID) development project seeks to develop the scientific identity of all students in the STEM undergraduate setting. In doing so, we propose a 3-component definition of Sci-ID and a 3-component intervention. We have included the following figure to summarize the definition of Sci-ID, 

![Sci-ID-Model](https://github.com/ec-belonging-in-biology/sci-id-development/blob/main/paper/figures/sci-id.png?raw=true)

In order to nurture Sci-ID, we propose a three-component intervention: a glossary of appropriate terminology to describe identities and associated concepts and structures clearly and concisely, a literature review of best practices to support students of underrepresented populations, and an index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists.

## 4 Discuss!

Lead your small group through your choice of questions, some are suggested below:

1. (For students of color) As a student of color, what would you say has been your most notable observation of white culture in STEM?

2. (For students of color) How have you learned to navigate the obstacles that come with being a person of color in STEM and what would you need from your community to sustain an equitable environment?

3. Is Emmanuel accessible? How or how not? How could it improve?

4. How do you think the system perpetuates the lack of POC in STEM fields? Do you think the system excludes anyone else? Does it favor a group? If so, how?

5. What could professors do to support marginalized students?

6. When and where do you feel most vulnerable on campus?

7. Which part(s) of your Sci-ID is strong? Weak? Why do you think it's that way?

8. Do you feel represented in the scientific community? How would you like to see that representation?

9. If you have privilege, how can you support your peers with less privilege than you? What does this look like in STEM?


## 5 Contribute!
