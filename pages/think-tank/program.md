# The Belonging in Bio Think Tank
*Tuesday, December 14th, 2021*

## Thank you!

Thank you so much for taking the time to participate in improving our STEM program here at Emmanuel. You will find all relevant info in this document - you will likely refer to it frequently during your discussions.

# Tonight's activities

## 1. Meet with your group

Get to know the group of people you'll be having some important conversations with regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Please introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, class, and major.

## 2. Review our community code of conduct

The project has an extensive community code of conduct, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/ec-belonging-in-biology/sci-id-development/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank"> here</a>. You don't have to review the whole things, however. For our purposes, it boils down to the following expectations for tonight:

* Remain empathetic and kind to one another
* Promote a safe environment for all
* And make space to:
  * Be present
  * Listen intently and deeply
  * Offer opportunities for growth while not "fixing" one another
  * Comment without assumptions
  * Seek understanding 
  * Share your individual truth while being aware of the differences between you and others, even if you share similar identities
  * Turn to wonder and learning when things get difficult or uncomfortable

## 3. Explore the project

The Scientific Identity (Sci-ID) development project seeks to develop the scientific identity of all students in the STEM undergraduate setting. In doing so, we propose a 3-component definition of Sci-ID and a 3-component intervention. We have included the following figure to summarize the definition of Sci-ID, 

![Sci-ID-Model](https://github.com/ec-belonging-in-biology/sci-id-development/blob/main/paper/figures/sci-id.png?raw=true)

In order to nurture Sci-ID, we propose a three-component intervention: a glossary of appropriate terminology to describe identities and associated concepts and structures clearly and concisely, a literature review of best practices to support students of underrepresented populations, and an index of diverse and accurately-represented scientists. he full paper can be found <a href="https://github.com/ec-belonging-in-biology/sci-id-development/blob/main/paper/Sci-ID%20development%20in%20underrepresented%20populations.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## 4 Discuss!

Your small-group leaders will lead you through discussion questions regarding DEI in STEM and the resources developed by the Belonging in Bio Project

## 5 Contribute!
